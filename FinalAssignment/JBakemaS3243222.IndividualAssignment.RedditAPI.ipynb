      ">Dark pools are private exchanges for trading securities that are not accessible by the investing public. Also known as “dark pools of liquidity,” the name of these exchanges is a reference to their complete lack of transparency. Dark pools came about primarily to facilitate block trading by institutional investors who did not wish to impact the markets with their large orders and obtain adverse prices for their trades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark pools aren't illegal, though they facilitate it occurring with lower likelihood of getting caught/reprimanded/fined. They've been around since the 1980s, and were theorized to be something that reduced volatility for stocks where large purchases or selloffs were going to occur from institutional investors. So, say, a mutual fund was going change their mix of stocks/bonds in a given fund, they may be changing that mix for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of individuals that aggregated up to millions of shares. A lot of 401k plans, for instance, are heavily into an array of different mutual funds, and the last thing many of those funds want to do is cause massive upward or downward movement on what are intended to be relatively stable, low volatility products. People really don't like seeing big swings in their retirement funds. They like to see them grow, they don't like to see them dip.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, dark pools aren't--in and of themselves--nefarious places for predatory behavior. They make a certain amount of sense situationally, and could, in fact, be utilized to keep little old ladies' retirement funds from seeing huge downward swings just because the fund wants to rebalance its mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "*However*, dark pools can be used to muddy the waters in high volume or high volatility situations to present pressure for only one side of a transaction. Want the price to go up, but a lot of people want to sell? *Route the sell traffic through the dark pool but the buy pressure through the normal exchange.* Want the price to go down, but a lot of people are wanting to buy? *Route the buy pressure through the dark pool, and the sell pressure through the normal exchanges.*\n",

      ">Mark to market is an accounting practice that involves adjusting the value of an asset to reflect its value as determined by current market conditions. The market value is determined based on what a company would get for the asset if it was sold at that point in time. At the end of the fiscal year, a company's balance sheet must reflect the current market value of certain accounts. Other accounts will maintain their historical cost, which is the original purchase price of an asset.\n",

      "Normally, anything on a company's balance sheet (assets, liabilities, equity and retained earnings) are always listed at historical cost. That is, what did you pay at the point in time you bought it. When a company, like say I don't know a hedge fund, owns stocks and bonds, those were generally listed for what was paid at time of purchase. Bought 200 shares of Microsoft in the 1994 for $2.50 a share? Well, you have $500 as an asset on your balance sheet for as long as you hold them.\n",

And because accounting has two sides to every transaction, when you increase the value of an asset, there's an offset.\n",

      "What is a reverse repo? Well from Investopedia \"A [reverse repurchase agreement (RRP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverserepurchaseagreement.asp) is an act of buying securities with the intention of returning, or reselling, those same assets back in the future at a profit. This process is the opposite side of the coin to the repurchase agreement. To the party selling the security with the agreement to buy it back, it is a repurchase agreement. To the party buying the security and agreeing to sell it back, it is a reverse repurchase agreement. The reverse repo is the final step in the repurchase agreement, closing the contract.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Why has the FED been going so crazy with these reverse repo agreements? Simple, there is way too much money in the American economy. Since the pandemic started, the FEDs money printer has been going BRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Here is a screen shot of the current inflation adjusted charts of the S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ:\n",

      "\n",
      "Why is this an issue? Well, because the fed has been printing money and giving it to the American people through stimulus checks and the amount of spending has gone down through the pandemic, the American people have more money parked in the big banks than ever before. The big banks are currently losing money on interest payments because of all this money. This is where the repo market comes into play. The banks don't want all this money, so they perform repo contracts with the FED. The banks are buying securities in the form of treasury bonds from the fed in order to get rid the money. The Fed then has to buy these securities back at a later date, and higher price. This is the essence of the repo market. The banks and the fed are using the repo market as a way to keep interest rates within their targets and control the amount of liquidity they both have. The FED wants to keep printing money to keep the economy running and the banks want to get rid of the printed money to keep the lights on. Now, how does this tie in with AMC and GME? Throughout the pandemic, large hedge funds such as shitadel have been shorting the absolute shit out of everything. This includes AMC, GME and other \"meme\" stocks, as well as treasury bonds. Yes, citadel has been even shorting treasury bonds. \n",

      "\n",
      "This is where it gets interesting. Since apes like you and I have been buying and holding AMC, GME the price has gone up due to gamma squeezes, momentum and some legal shorts covering. Shorts have been losing hundreds of millions of dollars on these stocks every day. The hedge funds currently are using options contracts, along with purchased shares to keep some profits going from the rising price, in order to short the stock even more. This is why it has been going on for so long. They lose money from these terrible short bets, but allow the price to rise and gain some cash from options contracts and other derivatives. As well, they route buying trades through the dark pools so it does not affecting the current market price, but then sell those same shares on the open market, which lowers the price. There is a feedback loop between the banks, FED and hedge funds. \n",
      "\n",
      "FED prints money which goes into economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banks receive this money and have to pay interest\n",
      "\n",
      "Banks perform repo operations with the FED to get rid of this money\n",
      "\n",
      "FED then has to buy these securities back at a higher price, as seen today with 502.904 billion dollars bought back of these securities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since citadel is a market maker, they allow the flow of these securities. But they have been shorting the fuck out of these bonds and a lot of different stocks throughout the pandemic. So how does it all end? The feedback loop will eventually be broken due to the increasing interest payments of losing short positions. When this happens, the banks won't be able to keep performing these repos, the FED won't be able to perform reverse repos, interest rates will either sky rocket or go negative I’m not sure which but I can tell you either one of those options will crash the economy. The FED and the banks have two options right now, hyperinflation and great depression. They can't keep this dance going for much longer since it is pretty much confirmed today that there is indeed ILLEGAL shorting happening to AMC and probably GME too. \n",

This is in addition to these 'Apes' causing subtle FUD with their DD.

This 'Ape' among us is very popular and was posting a lot of his 'DD' recently, but I checked his profile just now, and ever since I posted this and it blew up, he has not posted a SINGLE thing, which further confirms for me that this is legit.\n",

      "I won't be giving anymore info, everything else is with the SEC. I don't want there to be a witch-hunt. Those popular 'Apes' secretly trying to screw us over know who they are. The most important thing is to keep holding, the MOASS will come, there's nothing that can stop that. I just want you to be aware of these tactics. As long as you're cautious and aware of the FUD out there, and keep holding diamond hands regardless of dates or any subtle FUD, that's all that matters. They can't psychologically manipulate us, and we win.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would also like to ask Apes to please not harass airsocial. That could very well be a pseudo company and pseudo name he is using to protect himself in the event he was publicly exposed. Let the SEC handle this. They have a compilation of evidence to work with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there were other shill recruitment companies that released their info to Apes in the past, and that didn't end well for them, so it's plausible that they'd have contingency plans for whistleblowers to safeguard as much info about themselves as possible.\n",
      "\n",

    "There does seem to be a correlation between number of comments on a post and the upvote ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The negative score does indicate that posts with more comments have a lower upvote ratio, however, most data points seem to be grouped together with around 100-1000 comments, with a relatively high upvote ratio. Whether we can really say anything about the relationship is another point. \n",
    "\n",
    "It could be that thread that discusses strategy more in detail (more comments) would not necessarily lead people to upvote the post\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we could say that 'memes' uploaded on the subreddit could garner a higher proportion of upvotes because it entertains people, while simultaneously leading to less discussion in the comment section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third, albeit unlikely, explanation could be that people are more inclined to comment if they do not fully agree with the post, therefore creating more discussion in more 'controversial' posts.\n",
    "However, a strong criticism of this last point is that the dataset mostly includes posts that are in essence already in the 'top' posts of the year, so it simply looks at the low upvote ratios within a set of relatively highly upvoted posts. "
